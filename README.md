# js30

I'm following along with Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 course, and when possible
I intend to build an additional project of my own using what I learned. 
In the first project, I built the drum app, as well as beginning on a piano app.

Unfortunately it's surprisingly difficult to find piano key sounds for a full keyboard
so while the app is technically working, it doesn't have a full range of keys. A-F correspond to C-G on a keyboard though! :)

Improvements:

Obviously need to find and replace the correct piano key audio. Can also restyle the piano keyboard differently to how
it was done in the demo. 

Challenges:

I found it difficult to keep up with Wes as he explains things quite quickly, and some of the ES6 JS syntax he was using
was less familiar to me. Kept relistening to sections to get a clearer understanding though. Made note to study ES6 template
strings re. embedding expressions.
